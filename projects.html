  <h1>List of Projects: </h1>
  <h2><u> Modeling a Differential Drive Robot (DDR) </u></h2>
      <a href="https://github.com/LeoDoak/Modeling-DDR"> Github Link </a>
      <h3> Description: </h3>
      <p> For this project, we aimed to model the kinematic model of a differential drive mobile robot.
          In this model the accelerations of the left and right wheel are the system inputs. We model the
          velocity,angular velocity, position and the heading. We test the system via standard
          inputs through implenting the discrete time function of the model. We analyze the
          scenarios that included different intital conditions and a scenario where an input is
          changed during the simulation. For each test, a plot and a description of the behavior is provided.
          We also modeled the behavior of the model through the use of PIDs and MPCs in order to reach a desired linear velocity,
          a desired angular velocity, and a desired angular and desired linear velocity.
          The aim of the PID and MPC is to alter the left and right wheel accelerations in order to reach a target velocity,
          target angular velocity, or a target angular and target velocity. </p>
      <h3> Programming Languages Used:</h3>
      <p> Python, LaTex, Markdown </p>
      <h3> Libraries Used:</h3>
      <p>Matplotlib, Numpy, Casadi, and DO-MPC </p>
    <h2> <u> Flask OneDrive Web Application </u> </h2>
      <a href="https://github.com/LeoDoak/OneDrive-Flask-Web-App"> Github Link </a>
      <h3> Description: </h3>
      <p> Web application that was created with Python and utilizes the flask framework. The web application allows the
      users to login to their OneDrive account, create groups, add files to groups, and share these groups with other users through
      OneDrive. Allows the user to favorites, download, and delete files. </p>
      <h3> Programming Languages Used:</h3>
      <p> Python, html, javascript </p>
      <h3> Libraries Used:</h3>
      <p>Waitress, Pillow, sqlite3, numpy, Flask-login, msal, requests, ipython, Flask_wtf, json, urllib, os  </p>
  <h2> <u> Paper Helicopter Experiment and Analysis </u></h2>
      <a href="https://github.com/LeoDoak/Helicopter-Experiment"> Github Link </a>
      <h3> Description: </h3>
      <p> As a group of 3 we designed an experiment to test which factors would cause our paper helicopters to descend faster
      or slower. For our factors we had two main factors, paperclip size and size of helicopter. The blocking factor was the group member
      that would make the paper helicopter and drop them. We then ran the experiment with 90 trials in total and analyzed the data using R code to
      try and make conclusions between relationships of factors.</p>
      <h3> Programming Languages Used:</h3>
      <p> R </p>
      <h3> Libraries Used:</h3>
      <p> nortest, stats, MASS, agricolae </p>
